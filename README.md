Problem statement - Delayed Medical Response and Inadequate AI-Driven Support for Medics & BattalionsIn critical combat situations, the delay in identifying and reaching injured personnel leads to preventable fatalities due to lack of real-time triage and routing support.
Lack of Real-Time Threat Detection and Fragmented Battlefield Intelligence and No Unified Situational Awareness for Command Units:There is no autonomous system currently deployed that continuously detects, classifies, and reports enemy presence, obstacles, or ambushes during troop or medical movement. Vital data such as enemy movements, injured soldier locations, and blocked routes are often dispersed across disconnected systems or delayed by manual reporting.
Absence of Secure Routing:Routing and response decisions rely on insecure or static communication lines, exposing troop movements to interception or miscoordination.
